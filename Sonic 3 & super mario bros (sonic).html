<h1> <u> Background:</u> </h1>
<h4> Sonic the Hedgehog is a character created by the Japanese game developers Yuji Naka and Naoto Ohshima. 
He is the star of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise and the mascot of the Japanese video game company Sega. 
Sonic is an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog who can run at superSonic speed.</h4>

<h1> <u> Appearance:</u> </h1>
<h4> Sonic is an anthropomorphic hedgehog with blue fur that covers most of his body, and peach skin that covers his arms, muzzle, insides of his ears and front torso. He has small, triangular ears on top of his head, six long quills on the back of his head, two spines protruding from his back behind his shoulders, and a short tail. Sonic is 100 centimeters (3 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 35 kilograms (77 lb).[3] For attire, he wears red shoes and white gloves.
Sonic's original design gives him a short body, with a round torso and black eyes. His current design features a taller and thinner body with green eyes. Originally, he was shown to have peach-skinned eyelids, until they were changed to blue in Sonic Heroes.
For a list of Sonic's alternate outfits, see Sonic the Hedgehog/Miscellaneous#Outfits.
