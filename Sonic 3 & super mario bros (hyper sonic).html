<h1> <u> Background:</u> </h1>
<h4> Hyper Sonic (スーパーソニック[1] Sūpā Sonikku?) is a transformation that appears in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. 
It is the Hyper State of Sonic the Hedgehog, achieved by harnessing the positive power of the seven Chaos Emeralds.
As his ultimate form, Hyper Sonic has been by far Sonic's most common transformation since the West Side Island incident and would become the hedgehog's greatest trump card against his adversaries in the climaxes of later adventures, providing him with both the power and abilities to save the world on numerous occasions.</h4>

<h1> <u> Appearance:</u> </h1>
<h4> Hyper Sonic looks virtually identical to Super Sonic, sharing the same body proportions and raised quills. 
However, instead of a golden hue, Sonic's body rapidly flashes in pink/bright red, sky blue, lime green, yellow, #F9F9F9 and light violet - the same colors as the Chaos/Super Emeralds. 
He also has large flashing sparks floating around him. When moving, he leaves several after-images.

<h1> <u> Trivia:</u> </h1>
 <li>Hyper Sonic's name comes from the term hypersonic, which is a speed above supersonic (which is defined as any speed Mach 5 or greater).</li>
 <li>Takashi Iizuka does not believe there is any possible way for Sonic to become Hyper Sonic anymore, giving the explanation why Sonic 3 & Knuckles is its only appearance in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.</li>
 <li>Much like his Super State, when Sonic is in his Hyper State, due to the hardware limitations of the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, certain objects glow in the same colors he is in due to using shared palettes, such as various Flickies and Item Boxes, as well as his life icon in the bottom left of the HUD.</li>
 <li>Like with Tails and Knuckles, if the player turns into Hyper Sonic with S in Debug Mode, when the level ends and quickly turn back into a box, the name "Sonic" in "Sonic Got Through Act 1/2" turns into Hyper Sonic's colors.</li>
 <li>Hyper Sonic can also be used in Sonic & Knuckles, though only by breaking an S monitor in Debug Mode, itself being only usable in the game by performing a glitch in Sonic 3 & Knuckles. However, he still works as normal.</li>
 <li>In the files of Sonic Mania concerning Special Stages, the word "Hyper" can be found. This could mean Hyper versions of characters as seen from Sonic 3 & Knuckles were planned, but were later scrapped during development.</li>
 <li>Ian Flynn pitched Hyper Sonic to be the form used to battle The End in Sonic Frontiers. In this original pitch, Sonic would have initiated the transformation by calling out to the will of all the Ancients and Koco left in Cyber Space, absorbing the remaining energy to transform his Super State into Hyper Sonic. However, this idea was rejected.</li>
 <li>The Archie Sonic comic series is the world’s longest-running comic series based on a video game.</li>
 <li>Although the pitch was rejected, one of Sonic's lines from it would be kept. As such, in the final game, Sonic still calls upon the Ancients for help prior to his battle with The End.</li>
 <li>It is also possible that Starfall Super Sonic may have been a retool of this idea, and a potential reference to Hyper Sonic.</li>
