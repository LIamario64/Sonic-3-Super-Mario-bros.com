<h1> <u> Background:</u> </h1>
<h4>Luigi is Mario's younger but taller twin brother, the secondary protagonist of the Super Mario franchise, and the main protagonist of the Luigi's Mansion series. 
Throughout his life, he has lived in Mario's shadow, developing both cowardly and heroic tendencies. 
Despite this, Luigi has helped and fought alongside his brother on many occasions. Mario Bros. 
the Game & Watch marks his first appearance, in which he is an exact copy of Mario.
He went on to gain a different color and be used to facilitate a second-player option.
However, as Luigi established himself throughout the Super Mario franchise, he gained his own identity as a character.

<h1> <u> Appearance:</u> </h1>
<h4>Luigi is portrayed as the taller, younger brother of Mario, and is usually seen dressed in a green shirt, dark blue overalls, and a green hat with a green "L" insignia.</h4>

<h1> <u> Trivia:</u> </h1>
 <li>Luigi first popped up in the 1983 arcade game Mario Bros. as the character ran by the second player, it was also done in Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, and other games.</li>
 <li>The first game where he was present as the first character was Super Mario Bros. 2. In current games, the role of Luigi became small.
 He is only in spinoffs such as the Mario Party and Mario Kart series, though he was the top character three times before.</li>
 <li>First in the education game Mario Is Missing! in 1991, in Luigi's Mansion for the Nintendo GameCube in 2001, and in Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon for the Nintendo 3DS.</li>
 <li>In all of these games, he is called upon to be the brave person to save Mario. 
 Luigi has also popped up in every show of the three DiC TV series based on the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo Entertainment System games.</li>
 <li>At first he was made as a palette swap of Mario with a green color instead of red. 
 Luigi has since gottena character and manner of his own. As his part in the Mario series progressed, Luigi became taller and thinner than his brother. 
 Nintendo called 2013 "The Year of Luigi" to mark the thirty years of the existence of the character.</li>
 <li>Similarly, games being released in 2013 bring attention to Luigi, such as Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, Mario & Luigi: Dream Team, Dr. Luigi, and the level pack New Super Luigi U for New Super Mario Bros. U. 
 In Super Mario 3D World a Luigi take of Mario Bros. 
 called Luigi Bros. 
 is able to be unlocked.</li>
 <li>The events leading to the creation of Luigi began in 1982, during the making of Donkey Kong.
 The Nintendo designer Shigeru Miyamoto had created Mario (who used to be "Jumpman") hoping that he would be able to present the character in many different pars in future games. 
 Miyamoto had been given ideas by the game Joust to create a game where two players can play at the same time. This was the cause of his development of the game Mario Bros. in 1983, with Luigi as the brother of Mario and the second playable character. 
 The name Luigi is said to have been inspired by a pizza business near the head office of Nintendo of America in Redmond, Washington, called "Mario & Luigi's". Miyamoto noticed that the word ruiji means "similar" in the Japanese language, and that Luigi was designed to have the same size, shape and gameplay of Mario.</li>
