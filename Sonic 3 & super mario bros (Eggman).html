<h1> <u> Background:</u> </h1>
<h4>Doctor Ivo Robotnik (ドクター・イヴォ・ロボトニック Dokutā Ivo Robotonikku?), better known by the alias Doctor Eggman (ドクター・エッグマン[18] Dokutā Egguman?), is the main antagonist of the Sonic the Hedgehog series. 
A brilliant scientist with an IQ of 300, Eggman is driven by a desire to conquer the world and establish his own empire, the Eggman Empire. 
Central to his vision is Eggmanland, a city he seeks to build as the backbone of his regime. 
His ambitions are fueled by his love of machines and extreme egomania.
Eggman continually devises plots to achieve world domination, which range from using Animals to power his robots—known as Badniks—to constructing massive war machines, harnessing ancient powers, and manipulating spacetime itself. 
Despite his genius, his plans are always foiled by Sonic the Hedgehog and his friends. 
Nevertheless, Eggman remains undeterred, always managing to escape capture and continuing his quest for conquest. His narcissism and immature behavior often lead to his downfall, but his unrelenting pursuit of power makes him one of the most dangerous threats in the universe.</h4>

<h1> <u> Appearance:</u> </h1>
<h4> Eggman is an obese human with a small, bald head. 
He has a distinct pinkish nose and a bushy, mahogany mustache. 
His eyes, which are very rarely seen, are colored blue. Eggman's height is 185 centimeters (6 ft 1 in) and he weighs 128 kilograms (282 lb).
Eggman's Classic design features a totally spherical torso with thin but proportionate arms and legs. 
He wears a red top with a short yellow cape, attached to his shoulders by a triangular collar, black pants with attached boots and a pair of large silver buttons on the front. 
This outfit is complemented by white gloves and blue pince-nez glasses that completely hide his eyes. 
His mustache is neatly groomed, with only three tufts sticking out at each end.
In his Modern redesign, Eggman is depicted as somewhat taller and burlier. 
His arms and legs have become long and almost disproportionately thin, while his mustache has become more unkempt. 
For attire, he retains his signature glasses and gloves but incorporates the "Egg Goggles" which sit on his forehead, although he very rarely uses them. 
He now dons a red coat adorned with four golden buttons on each side of the chest, each accompanied by white straps running to additional identical buttons on the back. 
The coat features silver linings down the back, arms, and front, yellow cuffs, and two extensions on the front with large silver buttons. Additionally, Eggman wears black pants with matching boots, which have circular plates on both sides of the ankles and three square ones extending up the shin.</h4>

<h1> <u> Trivia:</u> </h1>
 <li>Eggman has blood type B.</li>
 <li>Rather fittingly, people with such type of blood are described as selfish but creative and passionate according to the pseudoscientific blood type personality theory, which is widespread in Japan..</li>
 <li>In the opening of Team Sonic's story in Sonic Heroes, what appears to be Eggman's signature can be partially seen on the letter he sent to the heroes. 
 It consists of the word "Eggman" written in cursive.</li>
 <li>However, in the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 version of Sonic Unleashed, a different signature was shown in one of Eggmanland's souvenirs. 
 This one consists of the writing "DR. Eggman" and a drawing of the doctor's mustache and glasses.</li>
 <li>According to Orbot, Eggman has lost to Sonic at least 227,000 times as of Team Sonic Racing.</li>
 <li>Although, it is likely a hyperbole due to in that case Sonic and Eggman would have to fight, at best, much longer than Sonic's life, and at worst, for hundreds of years.</li>
 <li>Despite his general disdain towards nature, Eggman was said to have a vegetation garden somewhere onboard the Final Fortress.</li>
 <li>According to Takashi Iizuka, Eggman makes his eggs sunny-side up.</li>
 <li>Also according to Iizuka, Sonic Forces probably marks the only point where Eggman will be most successful in his goals.</li>
 <li>Eggman does not regret blowing up half of the moon in Sonic Adventure 2, nor does he care about whether or not his publicist got upset about it.</li>
 <li>According to a promotional ad for Sonic Jump (2012), Eggman can merely jump a single meter (3,28 ft.) in a minute, as opposed to Sonic's 342 meters (1122,04 ft.) in that same time.</li>
 <li>Apparently, Eggman does not enjoy being on teams.</li>
 <li>Eggman appears to love taking selfies, supposedly having around ten terabytes just of them in his computer.</li>
