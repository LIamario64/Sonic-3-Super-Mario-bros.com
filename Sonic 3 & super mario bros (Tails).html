<h3> <u> Debut:</u> Sonic 2 </h3>

<h1> <u> Background:</u> </h1>
<h4>Miles Prower was born on West Side Island[4] with a genetic abnormality that gave him two tails. 
This trait earned him the nickname "Tails" and made him a frequent target of bullying.
Tails' life took a positive turn when he met Sonic the Hedgehog, who had set up camp on West Side Island while adventuring. 
He idolized Sonic for his positive attitude, and followed him around the island when the hedgehog resolved to thwart Doctor Eggman's plan to gather the seven Chaos Emeralds. 
He proved a valuable partner, helping Sonic reach Eggman's Death Egg and defeat the doctor there.</h4>

<h1> <u> Appearance:</u> </h1>
<h4> Tails is an anthropomorphic fox cub with two tails. 
He possesses mostly amber fur, with white fur around his muzzle with cheek tufts, belly and his tail tips. 
 also has large triangular ears with white canals on top of his head, a small black nose, and three locks of hair on his forehead. 
 For attire, he wears cuffed white gloves, white socks, and red and white shoes.</h4>

<h1> <u> Trivia:</u> </h1>
 <li>Miles Prower (Japanese: マイルス・パウアー, Hepburn: Mairusu Pauā), nicknamed Tails (Japanese: テイルス, Hepburn: Teirusu)</li>
 <li>Tails Loves Mint Candy</li>
 <li>He devours the little wrapped circles of goodness in the game Tails' Skypatrol.</li>
 <li>In the Game Gear version of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, the storyline took a slightly different route than its bigger Genesis/Mega Drive brother. Tails has been captured by the devious Dr Robotnik and it’s up to Sonic to step into action and save him. If players grab all the Chaos Emeralds, Tails is freed and everything’s all chipper again. But if Sonic fails, he gazes at the sky to a picture of Tails in the clouds. The rather grim ending suggests that Tails may have met his fate at the hands of the bad doctor...</li>
 <li>There are many different stories of how Tails met Sonic; and it tends to vary from Japanese through to English! The Japanese manual for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 suggests that tails was bullied by other animals for his two tails. He spotted Sonic zipping about and trained to keep up this his speed, eventually earning his place on Sonic’s radar. Some comics suggest he was adopted, or even saved from drowning by the speedy hedgehog.</li>
 <li>Intelligent, mythical beings? That’s Tails in a nutshell. Inspired by Japanese foxes, Kitsune, these foxes can grow up to nine tails. Miles “Tails” Prower bares two, and can spin them with ease to fly about, and again a helpful boost of speed!</li>
 <li> Who actually likes lightning? Tails is particularly afraid of lightning, and is said to have astraphobia; an irrational fear of thunder and lightning. Interestingly its one that both humans and animals can develop. It first became apparent in the Sonic the Hedgehog ‘90s flick and later on in the Sonic X TV series. Poor little bub!</li>
