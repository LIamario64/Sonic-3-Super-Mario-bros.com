<h1> <u> Background:</u> </h1>
<h4>Knuckles the Echidna (ナックルズ・ザ・エキドゥナ Nakkuruzu za Ekiduna?) is a character that appears in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. 
He is an anthropomorphic echidna and the current guardian of the Master Emerald, a powerful ancient gemstone which is kept on Angel Island. 
Guarding it is his solemn duty to protect from anyone seeking to abuse it, as well as the sole surviving descendant of the echidna race from the Knuckles Clan.
Known for his powerful and wild nature,[10] his dominant traits are his super strength and the two spike-like knuckles on each of his gloves, from which his name is derived from, and which he can dig and climb walls with. 
He can also trap the wind under his dreadlocks to glide through the air. 
Knuckles is also one of Sonic the Hedgehog's oldest friends and rivals.
A loner by nature, Knuckles is independent, headstrong, and serious, yet gullible and short-tempered to a fault. 
He is entirely devoted to his duty, spending most of his time on Angel Island protecting the Master Emerald, and rarely cares about anything that is of no importance. 
When his friends and others are in need of his help, however, Knuckles can always be relied on, being willing to leave his home very often.
Though usually depicted as the guardian of the Master Emerald, he was originally described as the guardian of Angel Island's seven Chaos Emeralds.</h4>

<h1> <u> Appearance:</u> </h1>
<h4> Knuckles is an anthropomorphic echidna with red fur that covers most of his body, a black nose on his peach-skinned muzzle, a white crescent-shaped patch of fur on his chest, sharp teeth, (only visible when he is smirking or angry earlier) and amethyst eyes. 
He also has seven dreadlock-like spines around the sides and back of his head and a medium-sized, tri-crooked tail. 
For attire, Knuckles wears red and yellow shoes with green cuffs, light gray soles, and metallic, sextuple-bolted plates on top. 
He also wears large, white, mitten-like gloves with sock-like cuffs and two pointy, spiked knuckles on each hand.
In his younger years, Knuckles had black eyes, a more protruding chest, more defined cheekbones, and was shorter in stature.
