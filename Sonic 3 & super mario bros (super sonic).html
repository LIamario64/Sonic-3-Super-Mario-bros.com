<h3> <u> Debut:</u> Sonic 2 </h3>
</ul>

<h1> <u> Background:</u> </h1>
<h4> Super Sonic (スーパーソニック[1] Sūpā Sonikku?) is a transformation that appears in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. 
It is the Super State of Sonic the Hedgehog, achieved by harnessing the positive power of the seven Chaos Emeralds.
As his ultimate form, Super Sonic has been by far Sonic's most common transformation since the West Side Island incident and would become the hedgehog's greatest trump card against his adversaries in the climaxes of later adventures, providing him with both the power and abilities to save the world on numerous occasions.</h4>

<h1> <u> Appearance:</u> </h1>
<h4> When transformed into Super Sonic, Sonic's proportions remain unchanged for the most part, and he still wears the same gloves and shoes he normally wears. 
Various changes include his blue fur becoming golden yellow in color, his green pupils turning red, his peach skin gaining a slightly golden hue, and the quills on his head pointing upwards. 
He also possesses a golden aura that varies in size and can be anything from smooth to flame-like in shape. 
This aura sometimes displays either faint sparkles or electrical sparks.
Super Sonic's original design has a round torso and black pupils, with his back quills upturned like those on his head, retaining their normal position later on, and lime colored pupils. 
Super Sonic's current design, just like Sonic himself, has become taller, with a thinner torso and red eyes.
