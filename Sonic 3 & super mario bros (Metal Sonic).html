<h1> <u> Background:</u> </h1>
<h4> Metal Sonic (メタルソニック Metaru Sonikku?) is a character that appears in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. 
He is a Badnik model created by Doctor Eggman, modeled after Sonic the Hedgehog. Metal Sonic can imitate Sonic's abilities and achieve speeds matching his own. 
Widely regarded as one of Eggman's greatest creations, Metal Sonic first appeared in Sonic the Hedgehog CD, and has been a recurring antagonist ever since.
While usually serving as Eggman's obedient and silent enforcer, Metal Sonic is an intelligent robot with a very dark side. 
Cold-hearted and ruthless, he is obsessed with proving his superiority to Sonic and eliminating him for good to the point where he has rebelled against Eggman more than once to achieve his goal. 
However, he always fails in the end, only to later return more powerful than before. 
To this day, Metal Sonic remains one of Sonic's most dangerous foes.</h4>

<h4><a href=https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_Sonic>Sonic Wiki</a></h4>
<h1> <u> Appearance:</u> </h1>
<h4> Metal Sonic was created in the image of Sonic the Hedgehog and is thus mostly built of blue metal. 
He has a yellow circular depression in his chest with a black center, mirroring the peach skin on Sonic's chest. 
His head has metal fins resembling Sonic's quills and a pair of triangular "ears." Metal Sonic has a muzzle, shoulder plates, upper arms, legs, and fingers made out of silvery metal. 
His palms are black, while the backs of his hands are square yellow plates. 
His forearms and lower legs are blue metal like his head and torso, and he has red feet with white stripes designed to resemble Sonic's shoes. 
To simulate the hedgehog's eyes, he has monitors with cameras behind them,giving them a red sclera.
Following the Ifrit incident, Metal Sonic received a slight update in design which made him taller and gave him a more ellipsoid torso. 
He also gained more detailed hands, a brilliant blue paint job, joints on his arms and legs, and sharper eyeholes.</h4>

<h1> <u> Trivia:</u> </h1>
 <li>In promotional art for <a href=https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_CD>Sonic the Hedgehog CD</a>, Metal Sonic's irises were red, but in the game, they are grey (or yellow during his <a href=https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/V._Maximum_Overdrive_Attack>V. 
 Maximum Overdrive Attack</a>).</li>
 <li>Metal Sonic has a mouth on the American cover of Sonic the Hedgehog CD.</li>
 <li>The help file included with the <a href=https://www.google.com/search?q=Personal_computer&oq=Personal_computer&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIPCAEQABgKGIMBGLEDGIAEMgkIAhAAGAoYgAQyCQgDEAAYChiABDIJCAQQABgKGIAEMgkIBRAAGAoYgAQyCQgGEAAYChiABDIJCAcQABgKGIAEMgkICBAAGAoYgAQyCQgJEAAYChiABNIBBzcwNmowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8>Windows 95 version</a> 
 of Sonic the Hedgehog CD claims that some early material refers to Metal Sonic as "Mecha Sonic". 
 This is considered a mistake.</li>
 <li>In the early Western release of Sonic & Knuckles, Mecha Sonic Mk. 
 II was also named "Metal Sonic".
 In the Japanese version, this robot was instead called "Mecha Sonic", and this was later used for the western version many years later.</li>
 <li>In the <a href=https://www.google.com/search?q=nintendo+ds&oq=nintendo+DS&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCggAEAAYsQMYgAQyCggAEAAYsQMYgAQyCggBEAAYsQMYgAQyCggCEAAYsQMYgAQyCggDEAAYsQMYgAQyBwgEEAAYgAQyCggFEAAYsQMYgAQyBwgGEAAYgAQyBwgHEAAYgAQyBwgIEAAYjwIyBwgJEAAYjwLSAQg4MjEwajBqOagCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8> Nintendo DS</a> 
 version of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games, Metal Sonic's winning animation mistakenly shows him with green eyes instead of red.</li>
 <li>Metal Sonic was planned to appear as a boss in the cancelled Sega Saturn game, Sonic X-treme. 
 Like the game's other bosses, his appearance in this game was unusually large in order to make him easier to hit. 
 Due to this game's cancellation, Metal Sonic didn't get a Sega Saturn appearance until Sonic R. Metal Sonic is the only boss in Sonic X-treme whose 3D model was found in the Sega Saturn SDK.</li>
 <li>Metal Sonic rarely speaks. 
 His voice is only heard during Sonic Heroes while in any of his transformations 
 (Neo Metal Sonic, Metal Madness and Metal Overlord, as well as when he is disguised as <a href="Sonic 3 & super mario bros (Eggman).html">Eggman</a>).</li>
 <li>Interestingly, he also shares Sonic's voice actor from this time, Ryan Drummond.</li>
 <li>He is the only Sega character who appears in Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games, but not in the Wii release of Sonic Colors.</li>
 <li>Metal Sonic has more alternate forms than any other antagonist in the Sonic the Hedgehog series.</li>
 <li>In the Sonic Riders series, Metal Sonic is the only playable robot that is not limited to one type of Extreme Gear.</li>
 <li>In the game Spiral Knights, players who purchased a copy of Sonic the Hedgehog CD on Steam before 31 January 2012 received a Metal Sonic costume for their knight. 
 This costume was also available to purchase in-game.</li>
